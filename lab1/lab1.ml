 *  Prints - : (int * int * int) list = [(1, 2, 3)] 
 *  Commas are reserved for tuples, so OCaml interprets the 1, 2, 3 as a (1, 2, 3) tuple with the () simply left out as a shortcut.

 *  Prints - : int = 6 

 *  if b > a then b else a + 2;   Why is this different from the previous case? 
 *  Prints - : int = 4 
 *  It's different because now the + 2 is part of a + 2 where the a is evaluated as the first parameter for the + operator
 *  whereas before the 2 + was separately the first part of an expression, and the second parameter for the + operator was the evaulation of the if. 
 *  The if/then/else operator has lower precedent that the + operator so it evaluates the a + 2 first.

 *  if b > a then b;
 *  Prints Error: This expression has type int but an expression was expected of type 
 *         unit because it is in the result of a conditional with no else branch 
 *  This is not a syntax error. Why does this give a type error? Hint: What does OCaml assume if the else in an if/then/else form is left off?
 *  It is a type error because all if statements require a following then and else statements where the return value for the then and else statements must be the same type. 
 *     f no else statement is provided, the an implicit else statement is evaluated with type unit. 
 *     Because the b is of type of int, the then statement is of type int, yet the else statement is implicity of type unit. Since their types don't match, it's a type error.

 (* Abiding by our evaulation model, we will either return a + b or a - b via the integer addition function or integer subtraction function. 
    The if statement within the parenthesis is a compound statement that evaluates to either int addition (if b > 0) or int subtraction (b <= 0),
    so we're able to have more dynamic control over calculations by conditionally selecting functions.
    Note that the effect of this is that the absolute value of b is added to a because if b is positive reguat a + b int addition occurs, but 
    if b is negative, int subtraction a - b occurs such that b's negative value get negated by the subtraction yielding a + |b| either way. 
    Also, note that we don't control (or take the abs value of) a, so if a is negative, we can still get a negative int result. *)

let rec p () = p ()
let test x y = if x = 0 then 0 else y

test 0 (p ())

    Using applicative order evaluation, the operands are evaulated first and then the operator is applied to the evaulated operands. 
    So, for test the operand 0 is evaulated, then p () is evaluated and because it has an infinitely recursive definition, the program 
    errors here and never eveluates test.

    Using normal order evaluation, all non-primitive operators are substituted for their compound procedures until only primitive operators are left,
    and then evaluation occurs. So, we first substitute in test yielding if 0 = 0 then 0 else (p ()). Then, we evaluate where the expression 0 = 0 is 
    true, so twe evaulate the then 0 resulting in 0, never needing to evaluate p (). 

    Here, applicative order evalaation errors due to the evaluation of the infinitely recursive p (), yet normal order evaluation yields a result of 0.

let rec sqrt_iter guess x =

         guess
         (sqrt_iter (improve guess x) x)

    There will be an error here, yet using regular if then else would run fine. Applicative order evaluation says to evaluate all 
    operands before applying the operator. So here, we must evaluate all operands of new_if first, regardless of the value of 
    its predicate operand. So, we end up with looping recursion such that (sqrt_iter (improve guess x) x) keeps being run continously 
    because new_if can't short circuit like if then else can to return guess. 
    The short circuit ability of if then else is necessary for if statements.
